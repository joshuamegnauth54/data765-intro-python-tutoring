    "[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an ancient package at the nexus of plotting in Python. `matplotlib` is vast and powerful but sometimes unwieldly due to its lower level nature. Other plotting libraries, such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), itself built on `matplotlib`, are a few layers higher than `matplotlib` and thus produce pleasing visualizations quickly. `matplotlib` implements the drawing primitives necessary for plots and provides full access to those objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally grew to love `matplotlib` after my thesis for this program as well as 790. Prior to those two courses I disliked `matplotlib` and even `seaborn`, both of which I felt were archaic and difficult. I now prefer `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to R's `ggplot2` after learning how to navigate the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as `ggplot2` and `seaborn` are excellent for reasonably aesthetic visualizations with a minimum amount of work. However, you will invariable need to drop down a few levels in order to produce more specialized visualizations. `matplotlib` is omnipresent and powerful. `ggplot2`, in my opinion, becomes increasingly convoluted whenever anything moderately complicated is required. The same could be said about R in general. Like `pandas` in relation to `NumPy`, `seaborn` et alia are intricately tied to `matplotlib` such that seamlessly moving between them vastly increases your productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official site lists [many of the third party](https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/) libraries built on `matplotlib`. I suggest checking it out to get a grasp on the landscape."
